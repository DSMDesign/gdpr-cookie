PHP cookie checker for Google Analytics, Tawk.To, Smartsupp and HotJar (GDPR Compliance)

This small class will add a cookie toggle window to any website.

To add this functionality within a site simply follow the below steps :

1. Upload the entire scwCookie folder into the public_html (or similar) root folder of your website.

2. If done correctly you will then be able to visit [domain]/scwCookie/install-check.txt and see the "Installed correctly" message.

3. Then add the following code before the closing body tag of each page:
```
<?php require_once $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/scwCookie/output/scwCookie.php'; ?>
```

4. Then open config.ini in your chosen editor and set the values to match your site configuration

Thats it, a window will now display in the footer of your site allowing people to manage the cookies you use.

#### Remeber to remove any previous cookie code, this will handle that from now on
